phlog is a horde log parser.  Given a horde log with verbosity of at least
INFO, phlog will give you statistics on a per-user basis, such as how many
times each user logged in (or attempted to log in), or how many messages he
sent.

The best source of documentation at the moment is `phlog -h`.  If you still
have a question, consult the code or contact the author.

The best source of documentation is `phlog -h`.  Consider this text a bare
primer on what phlog is and does.

phlog will Parse your Horde LOGs.  (P H LOG ... get it?  Nevermind.)  Given a
log from the webmail application Horde, phlog will output per-user statistics,
including how many times each user logged in, how many messages he sent, how
many distinct IP addresses were seen for this user, and several other related
data points.

Prerequisites:

  You need Perl.  You'll probably need to change the first line to reflect the
  location of perl on your system.  
  
  phlog was originally tested under Perl 5.8.8.  Later versions of Perl will
  probably be fine.  If phlog fails to work due to incompatibility with a later
  version of Perl, consider that a bug.  If it fails to work with an earlier
  version of Perl, reasonable changes may be made to accomodate, but this will
  be considered an enhancement request, not a bug.

  Your Horde installation must be set to log level PEAR_LOG_INFO.  More
  verbosity may work, but has not been tested.  (Bug reports welcome on this.)
  Less verbose logging won't produce the data for which phlog is designed.

  FreeBSD is the only tested platform so far.  If you find that it does or does
  not work on some other OS, I'd be interested to know.  I would expect it to
  work with a minimum of fuss on any system with Perl.

  Set your FQDN.  phlog needs to know the fully qualified domain name it will
  be using.  Uncomment the line where $fqdn is defined and set its value to
  your domain.

Usage:
  
  phlog [options] <horde.log>

  [command] | phlog [options]

  Options can be seen in `phlog -h`.  Most of them control sorting.  Some
  notable options:

    -h          Show help and exit.
    -V          Show version number and exit.
    -c          Show column headers above output.
    -v          Verbose - show IP addresses for each user.
